Welcome to the world of SuperPy, a sophisticated Python project designed to streamline your inventory management and sales processes. 
Let's embark on a journey through its features and commands, ensuring you make the most out of this powerful tool.

Installation:

First things first, install the required dependencies by executing the following command:

pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
Activate the virtual environment with:
source ./env/bin/activate

--------

Buy:

To initiate a purchase, command SuperPy with:

python main.py buy
Tailor your purchase with these arguments:

--name or -n: "Product name"
--price or -p: "Buying price of the product"
--amount or -a: "Amount of products" (default is 1)
--expiration or -e: "Expiration in days from the current day" (default is 10 days)
Examples:

python main.py buy -n Banana -p 0.55
This acquires a single banana for 0.55, expiring in 10 days.


python main.py buy -n Banana -p 0.45 -a 15 -e 5
This procures 15 bananas at 0.45, expiring in 5 days.

--------

Sell:

To facilitate a sale, utilize the command:

python main.py sell
Tailor your sale with these arguments:

--name or -n: "Product name"
--price or -p: "Selling price of the product"
--amount or -a: "Amount of products" (default is 1)
Examples:

python main.py sell -n banana -p 0.75
This sells 1 banana for 0.75.

python main.py sell -n banana -p 0.85 -a 10
This dispenses 10 bananas for 0.85.

--------

Advance:

To propel the internal date forward, invoke:

python main.py advance
Optionally, specify the number of days to advance with:

python main.py advance -d 5
This progresses the program by 5 days.

--------
Report:

Generate detailed reports for inventory, revenue, or profit with:

python main.py report [inventory|revenue|profit]
For a nuanced inventory report, use:

python main.py report inventory
This exhibits a table of current products in stock.

--------

For revenue and profit, customize your report with:

--today: Report for today
--yesterday: Report for yesterday
--date [day|week|month|year]: Report for a specific date
Examples:

python main.py report revenue --today
This furnishes the revenue report for today.

python main.py report profit --date 01-2020
This supplies the profit report for January 2020.

--------
Reset:

To obliterate all CSV files and reset the date, execute:

python main.py reset
Exercise caution, as this action erases all your data.

--------

Demo:

For testing purposes, engage the demo option:

python main.py demo
This loads demo data from a .json file and sets the date. Dive into SuperPy and experience the seamless management of your inventory and sales processes!
